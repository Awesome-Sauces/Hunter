# Hunter

Hunter is a plugin for Spigot/PaperMC 1.8.8

It's main purpose it to replicate bots from other Hypixel Pit remakes with the smoothest preformance possible and without
the hassle of having to code your own Bots! It utilizes CitizensAPI to be able to make the npc's. Its combat mechanics are done with raycasting and the SpigotAPI
If you wish to utilize this on your own server please be mindful that it hasn't been fully coded yet and won't be customizable until later on in the future.
